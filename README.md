Simple PHP shopping cart which I use for performance testing

I got this code from https://phppot.com/php/simple-php-shopping-cart/ and then made some
modifications for use in my class on web application performance testing.

Please feel free to contact the original developer for freelance work.

If you want any further information about my course on performance testing and tuning
for web applications then contact me via email -- del@babel.com.au
